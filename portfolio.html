    <h1>Portfolio</h1>

    <p>Paragraph 1: This portfolio page is where I will showcase projects I complete throughout this course and future web design work. Right now, it serves as a starting point that demonstrates how projects can be organized and presented on a website. Even though the content is still simple, the structure of the page is designed to make adding new work easy later on.</p>
    <p>Paragraph 2: So far, the main project featured in this portfolio is the creation of this multi-page website using semantic HTML. Through this assignment, I’ve learned how important navigation, page hierarchy, and clean code are to creating a functional site. Each project I add will build on these skills and reflect my progress as I learn more about design and development.</p>
    <p>Paragraph 3: As I continue working on this portfolio, I plan to include screenshots, descriptions, and links to completed projects. Eventually, I would like this page to feel more interactive and visually engaging once CSS is introduced. This portfolio will act as a record of my growth and a place to showcase the skills I develop throughout the course.</p>
