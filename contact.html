    <h1>Contact</h1>

    <p>Paragraph 1: This contact page is included to provide a dedicated place for communication and to complete the structure of the multi-page website. While the information here is currently basic, it helps make the site feel organized and easier to navigate. Having a contact page is an important part of most websites, even at an early stage of development.</p>
    <p>Paragraph 2: As this portfolio continues to develop, this page may include a contact form, professional email address, or links to other platforms. For now, it serves as a placeholder while I focus on learning how to properly structure content using HTML. Planning ahead for future features has helped me think more intentionally about how users interact with a website.</p>
    <p>Paragraph 3: Building this page also reinforced the importance of clarity and accessibility in web design. Simple layouts and clear labels make it easier for visitors to understand how to get in touch. Over time, this section will grow along with my skills and reflect a more complete and polished site.</p>
