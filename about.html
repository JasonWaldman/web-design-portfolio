    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>I created this website as part of my work in MFJS 3501 to learn the basics of web design and how websites are structured. This project helped me move beyond thinking of a website as just a single page and instead understand how multiple pages connect and work together. Building this site has been a good introduction to writing clean HTML and organizing content in a clear way.
</p>
    <p>Before this class, I had very little experience working with code, so learning how HTML works has been a challenge but also interesting. I’ve learned how important structure is, especially when it comes to headings, navigation, and accessibility. Seeing how small changes in the code affect the way a page functions has helped me better understand how websites are built from the ground up.
</p>
    <p>As the course continues, I plan to keep improving this site by adding more detailed content and eventually styling it with CSS. My goal is to make the site easier to navigate and more visually engaging while still keeping the code organized and readable. This portfolio will continue to grow as I complete more projects and build confidence in my web design skills.</p>

    <h2>What I’m working on</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Building clean multi-page navigation</li>
      <li>Using semantic HTML structure</li>

  <h2>More About Me</h2>

    I’m especially interested in communication strategy, digital branding, and creating
    user-centered web experiences. I like building clear layouts that make content easy
    to scan and navigate.
